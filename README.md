**Alternate Installation** (Not recommended)
- Get the latest [release](https://github.com/ryanslikesocool/MiniSceneManager/releases)
- Open with the desired Unity project
- Import into Plugins

## Dependencies
MiniSceneManager requires two dependencies
- [Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@1.21/manual/index.html)
- [Unity Foundation](https://github.com/ryanslikesocool/UnityFoundation)

## Usage
MiniSceneManager makes use of Unity's Addressables system, and works under the assumption that scenes are marked as addressables.
